# BannedWords
An open source list of banned words and their derivatives

Use these lists as you see fit.  They are meant to be an ever growing repository of all banned words for character names/name-able objects within a game.
This list is meant to include derivatives of banned words that players think up.  The idea is that as banned names are reported they will be added to this list so that they can be used by everyone.
This will decrease the amount of creatively inappropriate names encountered.  It it assumed that more than one space between characters is not allowed.  It is also assumed that all names are non-case sensitive.

Content within these lists is, of course, offensive.

Use and contribute to these lists as you see fit.  Please credit use of this list where used.

The lists are split up into their root words.  Not all root words may be offensive depending on the project.  The master list can be compiled by selecting which of the lists to use, creating one master comma delimited list to be imported into the database for the project.
